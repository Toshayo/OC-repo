# OpenOS OPPM repo

This is a small repo with some apps I want to update easily on several ingame computers.

## Installing

To register the repository, run the following command:

```bash
oppm register Toshayo/OC-repo
```


### Additional info about some packages

- **openos-error-handling-fix**: Install with -f option
(``oppm install -f openos-error-handling-fix``) so it can override system file.
This package fixes stacktrace being without error message.
